CSV IMPORT PROCESS INSTRUCTIONS

After making manual changes to the CSV file, follow these steps to import the data:

1. Run the transformation script to process the updated CSV file:
   cd /Users/iankleinfeld/Documents/WebProjects/Projects/dealership/src/loading_data && node transform_csv.js

2. Run the import script to load the data into the database:
   cd /Users/iankleinfeld/Documents/WebProjects/Projects/dealership && node src/loading_data/import_cars.js

The import script will:
- Extract make, model, and year from the title
- Extract price from the Price field
- Extract mileage and color from the Summary field
- Import all records into the database, even those with missing data
- Provide a count of successfully imported records and any errors

Note: The script is designed to handle missing data and will not skip records that lack certain fields.

To use this sql file on another computer, you would simply need to:

Install MySQL
Run the script with mysql -u root -p < setup_database.sql
Update the .env file with the appropriate database connection details
This will ensure that the database structure is identical across different environments.

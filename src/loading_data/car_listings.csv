If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you? If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do? COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly. I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there? Yes.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you? If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do? COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly. I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there? Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.

However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.

If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.

Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.

If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old.

Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.

Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you? If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do? COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly. I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there? Yes.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you? If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do? COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly. I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there? Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you? If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do? COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly. I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there? Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old.

Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.

Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.

You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.

Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old.

Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.

However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.

Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?

However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.

If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you? If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do? COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly. I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there? Yes.

The transmission is very smooth, has no leaks. The tires are nice, with plenty of tread and life left. The bus runs and drives without any issues. Is equipped with service tanks. One is a waste tank and the other a clean water tank. It is also equipped with a hand sink as well as a 3 compartment wash sink. There is a speaker system, sideslide service window,, and wired with 3 electric sockets to run refrigerator, freezer or other appliances. This bus was set up as a frozen and shaved ice business. However as a multipurpose vehicle, it can be easily converted to great food truck not investing much. Addionally it can easily be converted to camper or whatever you could imagine. Has 4 entry doors that provides for many options or uses. Now the not so perfect : I'm selling it as it is, therefor I haven't put addional effort to fix any of the included equipment knowing the options are unlimited for its future use. There are a few small mostly cosmetic items you may or may not want to address. The front passenger bus entery door will not latch closed, the rear emergency door is rusted on the bottom. Please look at the pictures to see these minor issues. There are a couple of other small rusty spots bubbling under the paint, but that's minor. If you chose to wrap the truck these may no need to be fixed. Otherwise it is a very solid body and solid frame. Comes with two freezers but are old and are more likely not suitable for restaurant use. The bus won't take much to be cleaned inside and out and made ready for its future use. I am sure it will be a great money maker for its next owner with not investing much. I'm asking 12K, with prices of these service trucks starting from 30K and the range goes up to 60-70-80k for almost same style food service trucks. Clean title in hand.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you? If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do? COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly. I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there? Yes.

We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do? COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly. I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there? Yes.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you? If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do? COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly. I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there? Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.

Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you? If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do? COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly. I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there? Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you? If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do? COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly. I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there? Yes.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time. This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you? If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you. You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot? No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit. Can I really secure financing with zero down payment? Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card. While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership. Do you take trade-ins? Yes. We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do? COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly. I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there? Yes.

We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.

We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases. What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth. This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle. Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.

Won't you negotiate? We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help. We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure. So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?
